# @ideasonpurpose/build-tools-wordpress

#### Version 0.0.0

Build scripts and dependencies for IOP's WordPress development environments.

## About This Project

These tools were migrated from our [Docker-based WordPress build tools](https://github.com/ideasonpurpose/docker-build) to speed up development and began the process of moving our build tools away from webpack. Gathering dependencies also simplifies the package.json files in host projects, making those slightly more manageable.

This may end up being the container for all tools required for building a project. That would allow us to clean out most of the cruft from our project directories and only have a single dependency which packages everything we need.

The included webpack.config.js file works best when paired with a PHP environment like our [Docker WordPress environments](https://github.com/ideasonpurpose/docker-wordpress-dev). It's capable of proxying to other servers, but that's sort of crazy.

### Additional Notes

This project expects an entirely ES Module based environment and specifies all dependencies using standard ESM import syntax. Projects importing this file should set `"type": "module"` in their package.json files.
